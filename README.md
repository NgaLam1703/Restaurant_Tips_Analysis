This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

## A brief description of what your project does

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of restaurant receipts and tips to uncover meaningful patterns in customer tipping behavior. The analysis explores how various factors‚Äîsuch as dining time (lunch or dinner), day of the week (weekday or weekend), customer gender, and whether they are a smoker‚Äîinfluence tip amounts.

In addition, the factors in the above dataset will have any other factors that affect customers' tipping.

Using Python and Colab, the project uses data visualization techniques and statistical methods to draw insights from the data. The goal is to identify correlations and trends that help explain restaurant customers‚Äô tipping behavior.
